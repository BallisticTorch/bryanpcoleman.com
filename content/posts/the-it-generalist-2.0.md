A little over a year ago I wrote an article titled [The IT Generalist](https://www.bryanpcoleman.com/the-it-generalist/). I wrote that a pretty low point in my life. It had been 10 or 12 weeks since I was let go from my previous job under shading circumstances, which I did not detail in that article, although I mentioned it in passing. Little did I know it would be a blessing in disguise, so to speak.

The previous article outlined my efforts to begin and succeed in an Information Technology career, so I would go into detail about it here. It is those efforts, and spending six months job searching that landed me in the position I have now: a System Administrator/Engineer for an MSP. Believe it or not, this position is perfect for someone who is an IT Generalist. What I mean by "generalist" is that there is no significant emphasis on one area of IT, i.e. programming, web development, network security, etc. Instead, a generalist is a "jack of all trades, master of none". In my previous article, I realized that is exactly what I am, and I described the trouble I had in finding employment suitable to my non-unique skill set.
