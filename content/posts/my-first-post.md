This is my first test post. I would like to guage how much of the text appears on the home page, how tags and categories are shown, and whether I need another menu item for the blog posts, or if it just works. This is a wonderful platform thus far and I look forward to what I can do with this. I can't wait to make this my permanent site and stop paying for hosting/Wordpress for good.
