Where does one begin when attempting to talk about themselves? Does one start with an origin story? Perhaps a journey of discovery? How about a story of overcoming adversity to reach one success or another? While those stories do exist, and I wouldn't be who I am today without them, I'm not wholly comfortable sharing those. After all, we did just meet!

Here's a snippet nonetheless of what got me where I am today.

To cover the basics, I am a disabled veteran of the United States Coast Guard - Sempur Paratus! I injured my back during a training session and for the last 18-plus years, I've been battling disc degenerative disease, scoliosis, and extreme levels of pain.   

Although my military career was short lived, my injury has afforded me an opportunity to pursue my passion - computers and software, also known as, information technology.

I graduated in 2011 from Kaplan University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology, concentrating on Network Administration. 

Within a couple of years, I had obtained certifications from CompTIA, the A+ and Network+ certifications that verify my knowledge, skills, and abilities in information technology, specifically networks.

I worked for several years before returning back to school; this time for a Master of Science degree. I graduated from Purdue University - Global, formerly known as Kaplan University, in August of 2018 with a Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity Management.

Wherever this path I am on leads, I am on it for the long hall. I have other dreams and aspirations too, and in time, those may appear here. For now, the  purpose of this site is to give you, the reader, some insight into who I am and to share with you my thoughts on technology and this ever changing industry.
