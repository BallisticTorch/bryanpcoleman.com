Where does one begin when attempting to talk about themselves? Does one start with an origin story? Perhaps a journey of discovery? How about a story of overcoming adversity to reach one success or another? While those stories do exist in my life, I feel those would be too personal to share with someone. After all, we just met!

Maybe later, when we've had a chance to get to know one another I can share these personal anecdotes with you. By the way, this is me hanging out in my home office, in front of my messy desk.

To cover the basics, I am a disabled veteran of the United States Coast Guard - Sempur Paratus! I injured my back during a training session and for the last 18-plus years, I've been battling disc degenerative disease, scoliosis, and extreme levels of pain.   

Although my military career was short lived, my injury has afforded me an opportunity to pursue my passion - information technology.

I graduated in 2011 from Kaplan University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology, concentrating on Network Administration. 

Within a couple of years, I had obtained certifications from CompTIA, the A+ and Network+ certifications that verify my knowledge, skills, and abilities in information technology, specifically networks.

I worked for several years before returning back to school; this time for a Master degree. I graduated from Purdue University - Global, formerly known as Kaplan University, in August of 2018 with a Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity Management.

Whether it is reading from my Kindle, playing 4X and RTS games on my computer, surfing the web to learn about all things technology, I am using or connected to one piece of technology or another. And that is the purpose of this site: to give you, the reader, some insight into who I am and to share with you my thoughts on technology and the ever changing industry.
